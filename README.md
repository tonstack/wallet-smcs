## TON Wallet Smart Contracts Collection

We created a collection of well-known smart wallets to make it easy for users and developers to navigate through them. The root of the repository contains directories with the names of such contracts, and they in turn contain versions directories in sequential versioning format (i.e. `v1`, `v2`, `v3` etc.) Each version of the contract has its own license and README.md files, and can be considered as a separate repository.
